## 👩‍💻 About Me

My name is Javiera Hartog and I have been a data analyst for approximately 5 years. I discovered the world of data in a copper mining company, working in the mineral extraction and production center. I worked in the operational area where I had to analyze the data and create improvement projects in the areas of maintenance, water resources and general operation. After a while I found a job in a retail and wholesale company for construction materials and household items. I worked in the Supply area as an Inventory management but my job was to work on data projects, uniting what was necessary from the information contained in SAP and creating reports that helped improve all supply management, from the purchase itself to the deliveries of the products and fillrate of providers. I am currently in Europe learning new skills and looking for new opportunities to further develop myself in the data area.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
