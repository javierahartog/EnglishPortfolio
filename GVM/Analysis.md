# Visually managing a copper mining 
## Material Extraction Data Analysis
<em>Operational Excellence Area</em>

In the world of data analysis, we come across projects that allow us to delve into specific industries and reveal valuable information. In this project, we focused on the visual management of a copper mining, where we explored the data related to the extraction of material in four different routes. Through this detailed analysis, we were able to obtain crucial information to optimize the efficiency and productivity of the mining operation.

The project had access to a set of data which contained detailed information on the route of the trucks for the extraction, the duration of each of these and their respective routes and other relevant parameters.

To get started, we perform a thorough data cleansing and preparation process via Python. We linked all tables that provided information relevant to the project, removed outliers, addressed missing data, and standardized units of measurement to facilitate further analysis. Once the data was ready, we proceeded to perform various visualization techniques to obtain a clear and understandable view of the patterns and trends present.

Using DAX and Power Query we create KPIs for charts and interactive visualizations through PowerBi. We explore the relationship between material extraction and key parameters such as operation time to discharge, number of daily trips, and the average distance traveled for each of the routes. These visualizations helped us identify seasonal patterns, peak months, and potential bottlenecks in material extraction.

In addition, we apply time series analysis techniques to identify any trends or seasonality in material extraction over time. This allowed us to understand how the factors influenced production depending on the routes with the most efficient performance and with it, the profitability of the mining operation, allowing us to suggest improvements and specific optimizations.
