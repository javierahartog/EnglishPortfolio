# Global sales management of a multinational
## Data preparation, analysis and visualization

<em>Sales Area</em>

In this project, we delve into the global sales management of a multinational. Through the use of SQL queries, data definition and manipulation, we were able to obtain a detailed profile of our sales base. Through powerful visualizations, such as a didactic map that shows the average sales by country, rankings of the countries with the highest percentage of sales and their annual comparison, overall sales history, as well as different KPIs on sales and repeat customers, we discover Crucial information to make strategic decisions and boost the business.

To begin our global sales management project, we dove into the vast amount of data at our disposal. We used DDL and DML to define and manipulate the relevant information, ensuring it was structured appropriately for further analysis.

One of the first tasks was to create SQL queries to obtain a detailed profile of our sales base. These queries enabled us to learn key data such as top-selling products, most profitable customer segments, and countries with the highest sales volume. This information gave us an overview of our customer base and helped us identify opportunities for growth.

Then, we connected this new, already synthesized database to generate a PowerBi teaching map that visualized the average sales by country. We assigned colors to each country based on their sales performance, making it possible to quickly identify the strongest markets and those that required the most attention. This visualization gave us a clear geographic perspective and helped us focus our efforts in the right places.

In addition, we create rankings of the countries with the highest percentage of sales and compare their annual performance. These annual comparisons allow us to identify trends and changes in sales patterns in each country, providing a deeper understanding of the factors that influence the success or stagnation of our operations.

To assess our historical sales performance, we analyzed data at a broad level and generated visualizations showing growth over time. This allows us to identify periods of accelerated growth and those in which challenges arose, providing us with valuable information for making strategic decisions.

Finally, we dive into different KPIs related to sales and repeat customers. We analyze key metrics such as customer retention rate, average purchase value, and purchase frequency to gain a more complete understanding of our business. These KPIs helped us identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to maximize customer loyalty and increase profitability.
