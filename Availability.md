# Availability in retail stores

## Data preparation, analysis and visualization

<em>Supply Chain Area</em>

In the world of data analysis, we find projects that allow us to improve efficiency and productivity in different business areas. In this project, we focus on the general availability of products in retail, specifically in the supply area. Using tools like DAX and Power Query in Power BI, we create a strong connection and perform the necessary data cleansing for accurate and detailed insights. Through required visualizations, such as a map showing product availability at each location, percentage availability broken down by locations, and availability by purchasing groups, we discover patterns and trends that allow us to optimize the sourcing process and ensure customer satisfaction. customer.

The retail general availability project focuses on ensuring that products are properly available in each store. To do this, we use DAX and Power Query in Power BI to establish a strong connection to the relevant data and perform the necessary cleanup.

First, we created a connection to the data source, which was an internal database hosted by SAP. Using DAX, we perform data transformation and KPI creation to ensure we have the necessary information for our analysis.

Once the data is clean and structured, we create meaningful visualizations to quickly understand product availability at each location. Using a map, we assign colors to each location based on their level of availability. This allows us to easily identify the areas with the greatest sourcing challenges and focus our efforts effectively.

In addition, we calculate the percentage availability broken down by premises. This metric gives us a detailed view of what percentage of products is available in each location. Using charts and tables, we can quickly identify the locations with the highest and lowest levels of availability, helping us make informed decisions to improve the sourcing process.

We also analyze availability by purchasing groups. We group the products according to different categories or segments and we evaluate the availability in each group. This allows us to identify the business areas that present the greatest challenges and provides us with valuable information to take corrective actions.
